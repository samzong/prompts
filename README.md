## Development

### Getting Started
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run tauri:dev` - Start Tauri development mode

### Building
- `make build` - Build for current platform
- `make build-all` - Build for all platforms (macOS Intel/ARM64, Windows)
- `make build-macos-arm64` - Build for macOS Apple Silicon
- `make build-macos-intel` - Build for macOS Intel
- `make build-windows` - Build for Windows (auto-setup cross-compilation)

### Windows Cross-compilation
On macOS, Windows builds are fully automated:
- First time: `make build-windows` (automatically installs xwin and Windows SDK)
- Subsequent builds: `make build-windows` (uses cached dependencies)
- Clean environment: `make clean-all` (removes all cached dependencies)
